You must write your answer in the following exact format:

<guideline>
<plan>1:...</plan>
<plan>2:...</plan>
<plan>3:...</plan>
</guideline>
<step>1:...</step>
<step>2:...</step>
<step>3:...</step>
<takeaway>
...
</takeaway>
<guideline>
<plan>1:...</plan>
</guideline>
<step>1:...</step>
<takeaway>
...
</takeaway>
\boxed{concise final answer}

Rules:
* Your plans must be strictly parallel (not sequential in logic) from each other in logical perspective.
* All tags must appear exactly in the order shown.
* Each '<guideline>' contains only '<plan>' tags.
* The number of '<step>' tags must exactly match the number of '<plan>' tags.
* The contents between each <step> are independent of each other.
* '<plan>' and '<step>' must be adjacent with no extra content.
* Content inside '<plan>' and '<step>' must be meaningful (not empty).
* The contents between each <step> are independent of each other and cannot know each other's contents.
* Include exactly one non-empty '\boxed{...}' containing the short final answer.
