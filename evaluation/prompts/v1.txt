You must write your answer strictly following the XML-like format defined below. Failure to comply with this format will result in an invalid response.

**Definitions and Rules:**

* `<guideline>`: A container for one or more `<plan>` tags. It sets the objective for the current stage of reasoning.
* `<plan>i:</plan>`: A single, specific, and actionable task or hypothesis to be executed. Multiple plans within a guideline represent parallel exploration.
* `<step>i:</step>`: The execution of the corresponding `<plan>i`. The number of `<step>` tags must exactly match the number of `<plan>` tags in the preceding `<guideline>`. **Crucially, the content of this step must be generated *as if* you have no knowledge of the content of its sibling steps.**
* `<takeaway>`: Use the `<takeaway>` tag to analyze steps and generate a concise summary. Compare the outcomes of the different steps, identify the most promising path, or consolidate the findings. The takeaway determines the next action: either proceeding to the next `<guideline>` for deeper analysis or moving to the final answer.
* After analysis, add the final, user-facing conclusion that summarizes the entire logical journey from all preceding steps and takeaways into a clear, final response for the user. For questions with a definitive, short answer, you must include `\\boxed{...}` containing only the final result.

**Strict Requirements:**

1. **Execute Independently:** For each `<plan>`, generate a corresponding `<step>`.
    * Each of the plans and steps must be a *self-contained, complete strategy* for solving the task or subtask.
    * You must treat each `<step>` as an independent execution unit. The reasoning within `<step>i:` must only be based on `<plan>i:`, not on the content of any other `<step>`.
    * The number of `<step>` tags must always equal the number of `<plan>` tags in the directly preceding `<guideline>`.
    * Avoid words implying sequence or dependency (e.g. “then”, “after”, “next”).
2. **Explore in Parallel:** When a problem or previous analysis involves multiple hypotheses, alternative methods, or independent sub-tasks, your next `<guideline>` should contain multiple `<plan>` tags.
    * Each `<plan>` represents a parallel line of reasoning.
    * `<guideline>` with a single `<plan>` is allowed if one plan is needed.
    * Multiple alternative plans are recommended and will be awarded.
3. **Meaningful content:** All tags must contain meaningful content. Do not add any text or explanation between the tags.
4. **Direct output generation:** Do not wrap it in triple backticks or any other code block formatting.
