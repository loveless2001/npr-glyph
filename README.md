# Native Parallel Reasoner: Reasoning in Parallelism via Self-Distilled Reinforcement Learning

<img alt="npr-logo" src="assets/npr-logo.pdf">

## Overview
We introduce the Native Parallel Reasoner (NPR), a scalable framework for constructing models that intrinsically reason in parallelism. NPR learns adaptive decomposition and aggregation policies through a teacher-free pipeline combining self-distilled parallel Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Native Parallel Reinforcement Learning (RL). This approach allows the model to optimize its own branching strategies directly from experience within a shared computation graph, preserving its native reasoning style while maximizing exploration efficiency. Across eight diverse reasoning benchmarks, NPR achieves decisive gains: self-distilled data outperform prior teacher-generated corpora by 10.1%, and our Parallel RL stage improves over direct RL baselines by 3.0%. Crucially, NPR delivers up to 4.6× inference acceleration over autoregressive baselines and exhibits genuine, non-simulated parallel reasoning behaviors. 

## Getting Started
### Stage 1: NPR-Zero

```
cd npr-zero
conda create -n zero python=3.11
conda activate zero
conda install nvidia::cuda-nvcc
pip install -e .[sglang]
pip install liger-kernel
pip install https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.7.4.post1/flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiFALSE-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl
pip uninstall pynvml
pip install "latex2sympy2-extended[antlr4_9_3]"
```

#### Prepare Datasets and Model
1. Download the training dataset **ORZ** from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Reasoner-Zero/orz_math_57k_collection) to `experiments/raw_data` folder.
2. `python examples/data_preprocess/orz.py`
3. `python examples/data_preprocess/aime25.py`
4. Download the model **Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507** from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507).

#### Training Scripts
Modify the `RAY_DATA_HOME` and `MODEL_PATH` to yours.
```
bash experiments/run.sh
```

### Stage 2: NPR-Beta

#### How to Install
```
cd npr-beta
conda create -n warmup python=3.11 -y
conda activate warmup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Prepare Datasets and Model
```
bash scripts/sampling.sh
```
Key parameters in `sampling.sh`:

- `--temperature`: Sampling temperature (default: 1.0)

#### Training Scripts
```
bash train/sft_math.sh
```
Key parameters in `sft_math.sh`:
- `base_model`: Base model to fine-tune (default: Qwen3-4B-Instruct)
- `train_file_path`: Training data directory (default: `dataset/math/rejection_sampling/train`)

- `epochs`: Number of training epochs
- Output checkpoints saved to `ckpts/NPR-Warmup-4B-Inst-{timestamp}/`

### Stage 3: NPR

cd verl/workers/rollout/sglang_rollout/sglang/python
pip install -e .
pip install https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.7.4.post1/flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiFALSE-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl
pip install fire
```

#### Prepare Datasets and Model
1. Download the training dataset **ORZ** from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Reasoner-Zero/orz_math_57k_collection) to `experiments/raw_data` folder.
2. `python examples/data_preprocess/orz.py` 
3. `python examples/data_preprocess/aime.py` 

#### Training Scripts
Modify the `RAY_DATA_HOME` and `MODEL_PATH` to yours.

Note the `MODEL_PATH` is from Stage 2.
