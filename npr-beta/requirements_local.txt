# sglang  <-- Commented out if it pulls Ray, or keep if needed for Rejection Sampling. 
# Since user asked to remove Ray complexity, and sglang often needs Ray, we might need to be careful.
# But npr-beta Rejection Sampling uses sglang. We can keep it but user should install with minimal deps if possible.
# For now, keep it as it's a core dependency of the code I saw.
