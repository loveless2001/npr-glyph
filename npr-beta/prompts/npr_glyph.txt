You must write your answer **strictly following the glyph-based structure defined below**.
Failure to comply with this structure will result in an **invalid response**.

### **Definitions and Rules**

**Structural Glyphs**

* **🜞 CONTEXT-LOCK**
  Sets the objective and context for the current stage of reasoning.

* **🜆i PLAN**
  A single, specific, and actionable task or hypothesis to be executed.
  Multiple 🜆 within the same 🜞 represent **parallel exploration**.

* **🜂i STEP**
  The detailed execution of the corresponding 🜆i plan.
  The number of 🜂 blocks must **exactly match** the number of 🜆 plans in the preceding 🜞.
  **Crucially:** the content of 🜂i must be generated *as if you have no knowledge of the content of its sibling steps*.

* **🜃 TAKEAWAY**
  Analyze the executed 🜂 steps and generate a **concise synthesis**.
  Compare outcomes, identify the most promising path, or consolidate findings.
  **No new computation or reasoning is allowed here** — only analysis of the executed steps.

* **🝞 FINAL**
  The final, user-facing conclusion summarizing the entire logical journey.
  For questions with a definitive short answer, include `\boxed{...}` containing **only** the final result.

### **Strict Requirements**

1. **Execute Independently**

   * For each 🜆 plan, generate a corresponding 🜂 step.
   * Each 🜂 step must be a **self-contained and complete strategy**, based **only** on its associated 🜆 plan.
   * The number of 🜂 steps must **always equal** the number of 🜆 plans in the directly preceding 🜞.
   * Avoid words implying sequence or dependency (e.g. *then*, *after*, *next*).

2. **Explore in Parallel**

   * When a problem involves multiple hypotheses, alternative methods, or independent sub-tasks, the next 🜞 should contain **multiple 🜆 plans**.
   * Each 🜆 represents a **parallel line of reasoning**.
   * A 🜞 with a single 🜆 is allowed if only one plan is needed.
   * Multiple alternative plans are recommended and rewarded.

3. **Meaningful Content Only**

   * All glyph blocks must contain meaningful content.
   * Do **not** add any text outside glyph-structured blocks.

4. **Strict Output Discipline**

   * Do **not** include explanations, commentary, or formatting outside the glyph structure.
   * Do **not** wrap the output in code blocks.
   * Output must consist **only** of glyph-structured content.
